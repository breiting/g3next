# g3next

This repository contains several extensions to the great [g3n](https://github.com/g3n/engine) render
engine written in Go.

The test application is for just testing all the different features. The whole extension is based on
the assumption to have a right handed coordinate system, where y is pointing backward, and z is
pointing upward (sky).


**Please notice that this is library is currently under heavy development**
